# AI_Project
This course aims to provide understanding of modern neural networks. Their representative models including basic neural networks, convolutional and recurrent neural networks will be covered, and also, various real world applications will be introduced. Students will perform a final project with open source libraries.

With this project, we studied about network intrusion detection problem with CNN+LSTM model.

And this is the paper we referenced on.
